Next version
------------

There is a new **account module** which add feature for user accounts into an application.
Its feature:
- page for the user to show and modify its profile (name, email, and any other informations
  if the application provides its own form and dao)
- commands to 
  - list accounts, 
  - attach/detach an account to an identity managed by an authentication provider
  - list attached identities to an account
  - create an account, or create an account with a loginpass identity
 

This new version implements also a **workflow for the authentication process**. 
The authentication process has several steps that modules can bring, allowing a high customization.
Major Steps are :
- primary authentication by an authentication provider (with a login form, or remote authentication etc..)
- retrieve of the application account corresponding to the authenticated user
- or creation of the account, if the automatic account creation is enabled
- second factor step, if a module provides a second factor for authentication
- access validation step : modules can provide additionnal steps, like   
  acknowledgment of terms of service, or a form to force to change the password, etc.
- final step: the user session is complete and the user can use the application.
 

**Other new features**:

- commands for the loginpass provider
  - to create/delete a login
  - to change a password
  - to list activated backends
  - to list logins
- support of password reset into the authloginpass module
